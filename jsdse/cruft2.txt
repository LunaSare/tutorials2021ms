\subsubsection*{d. Make it accessible geographically and through time}

We published the tutorials on a public, free license, free of cost, and free for
use and reuse repository and persistent website \citep{RopentreeTutorials}.
The tutorial is available for the users to go back to any time they need it,
and to be shared with other users and learners (Figure \ref{fig:schedule}).

We created a main version of the tutorial that is stable. Any updates to the tutorial are
published as new versions, or tutorials for new workshops \citep{wilson2006swc, SWCwebsite}
 Versions presented at workshops are a copy from the original repository.
They represent a temporally stable snapshot of functions and workflows presented
during a workshop.
