## Introduction

Reproducibility is important for Science.
Reproducibility is defined as the extent to which consistent results are obtained when an experiment is repeated (https://cure.web.unc.edu/defining-reproducibility/).
Scientific reproducibility in the natural sciences is low (CITE)
First, all components of research must be made available. In the case of data science research, raw data and code are the main components. How do you make something available? By depositing in a public repository.
Sometimes this does not always mean people can access it. For example, there might be some restrictions to data download, embargoed by the authors, or the repository might require a payment to download the code. Something that has been made available is not always accesible.



Second, steps must be clear and transparent, thoroughly explained. No steps missed.
In the case of research done only in computers.

Explaining of things is done via documentation.
Usually, documentation is written down using highly specialized formal language. Documentation is seen as a professional document, acceptance from the scientific community could be low if a more informal language is used.

How to balance acceptance and adoption?

Other types of documentation, such as tutorials and vignettes have become common practice, but sometimes even these are written using highly speialized language.

Accessibility is one of the key characteristics of reproducibility. Availability is not the same as accessibility.

Software is important.
Most softare has documentation.
Most of this documentation is written in natural language (that is english, ,or spanish or any human language known) and very often uses computational specific concepts, words, and phrases, that makes it very difficult for people unfamiliar with the language to adopt it. It makes it scary, and unapproachable. It makes it seem like a very hard task, unpassable, unsurpassable, like a mountain that is just too high and far away, and only the string and super smart can get to the top of it. 

Besides the documentation of the website, it is needed to provide examples or tutorials demonstration single function usage and analyses workflows demosntrating how the different function in a package link together to generate a particular analysis and results.

This secondary documentation should be written down using language that is common to the target audience.

One of the key aspects of open science is reproducibility
To achieve reproducibility three main aspects are required:

availability - that is providing the source data and code that was used to generate an analysis.
But something can be available, but not accesible. One example I really like is the marshmallows in an office. The marshmallow bags were there, availabe for anyone to eat them. But until someone opened th ebag and put the marshmallows in a tray or container, people started eating them. Maybe it was something psychological in this case. But the point is that simply sharing your code and documenting it might not be enough for the average researcher to reproduce, they'll be able to figure it out, but the time needed to do so might not be worthy in their mind, or might not be something they can invest in, even if it would be useful for them long term, the short term investment is too intense.

Let alone students that are just starting, it is even more daunting for them.
To make documentation of packages more accesible, using the most common language is the best. Explaining computational terms that are needed at the beginning and also throught the text.

We developed a set of tutorials for the Open Tree of Life package.

We have received emails from senior researchers thanking us for this materials, and students have been able to engage using the packages with less hep from the PIs.
