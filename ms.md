## Introduction

Scientific reproducibility, --the extent to which consistent results are obtained when an experiment is repeated (https://cure.web.unc.edu/defining-reproducibility/)-- is a key aspect for the advancement of Science (CITE).
Reproducibility in the natural sciences has been historically low (https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124), which has raised concerns about a reproducibility crisis in the field (CITE). 

Making available raw data from experiments, as well as computational code and documentation to reproduce the analysis is considered a key element to achieve reproducibility (https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2015.00827.x). Efforts to improve availability rates in the natural sciences have focused on cultural shifts towards data sharing, incentives, etc. 
However, availability does not automatically imply accessibility (Box 1).
Raw data, code and documentation can be made readily available through deposition in a public database or repository. However, even in this case, access can be limited to the general public. For example, there might be country or institution based restrictions to data download, data embargoes by the authors, or the repository might require a suscription to download the data.
Conceptual, financial, language, etc., accessibility must be addressed too. 

In fields where computation plays a significant role in deriving the scientific findings, accessibility of code and documentation is of particular importance to achieve reproducibility.
Primary documentation describes individual functions and general usage, sometimes accompanied with usage function examples.

As opposed to code, primary documentation is written in natural language (i.e., English, Spanish, Chinese, any known human language) and makes use of highly specialized computational jargon (computationally specific concepts, words, and phrases) as well as formal language, which often slow down or even obstruct examination, application, and adoption of code by external individuals. 

Because primary documentation is considered a professional document, acceptance of the research by the scientific community could be reduced if a more informal language is used.

Secondary types of documentation, such as vignettes and tutorials, demonstrating single function usage, analyses workflows, and function associations to generate a specific analysis and results. While secondary documenttaion has become more common, it is still often provided using highly specialized language. 

In this paper, we identify the necessity for secondary documentation that should be written down using language that is common to the target audience to facilitate examination, application, and adoption of code by the wider audience.

We present a series of principles to generate tutorials that improve accessibility of code and documentation. We applied these principles to a series of tutorials and vignettes for th eOpen Tree of Life package.

## Methods

### Principles
To make documentation of packages more accesible, using the most common language is the best. Explaining computational terms that are needed at the beginning and also throught the text.

## Results





We have received emails from senior researchers thanking us for this materials, and students have been able to engage using the packages with less hep from the PIs.


### Box 1
Availability does not impy accessibility. One example I really like is the marshmallows in an office. The marshmallow bags were there, availabe for anyone to eat them. But until someone opened the bag and put the marshmallows in a tray or container, people started eating them. Maybe it was something psychological in this case. But the point is that simply sharing your code and documenting it might not be enough for the average researcher to reproduce, they'll be able to figure it out, but the time needed to do so might not be worthy in their mind, or might not be something they can invest in, even if it would be useful for them long term, the short term investment is too intense.
Let alone students that are just starting, it is even more daunting for them.


## Discussion

The principles to create tutorials described here facilitate adoption of software and analysis wokflows among researchers at different academic levels, from undergards to established researchers.

It will also help closing the gap between students that had access to computational resources (and computational training) from an early age and students that did not. Late access to computational resources and training can occur due to lack of economic resources, often ocurring in households from underrepresented communities and minorites. It can also be due to gender-biased parental and community pressures, in which males are more often encouraged to perform activities related to computers, while females are discouraged.

How to balance software acceptance VS. adoption?
These principles can be used to aide not only reproducibility, but also software adoption in the natural sciences.
