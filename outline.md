Subject: “Teaching reproducibility and responsible workflow”

Premise:
The importance of workflow and reproducibility as a component of data acumen needed in our graduates.

Challenges to address:
1. technologies are rapidly evolving
2. few faculty were trained in the use of these methods
3. best practices have not been clearly identified
4. insufficient vetted and inclusive curricular materials are available
5. accounting for student heterogeneity and broadening participation
6. many aspects of student understandings in this area are unknown

To highlight work in this important and developing area, the Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education is inviting submission of papers related to “Teaching reproducibility and responsible workflow” to appear in a forthcoming issue.

Sample topics (non-exhaustive):
Teaching workflows and workflow systems
Fostering reproducible analysis
Promoting reproducibility as a component of replicability and scientific conduct
Developing and implementing documentation and code standards
Incorporating source code (version) control systems
Supporting collaboration Integrating ethics
Conducting effective formative and summative assessment


Goal of the ms:
A lesson in reproducible analyses for phylogenetics and evolution, separate from package publication.

Tutorials to include in ms (all?):
SSB workshop use of DateLife and rotl
Felipe’s python-opentree tutorial
ropentree tutorials



Goals of our tutorials:
Create vetted and inclusive curricular materials for reproducible phylogenetics and evolution.
Challenges that we consider:
Computational presence in the field of phylogenetics and evolution has increased considerably in the last 10 years.
Computing is not a common skill or interest among biologists. Teaching computing to a diverse audience with varying preparation and computing skills is one of the challenges.

A reproducible workflow for phylogenetics and evolution.
